This will be a short run through of the Jira process we adopt. The Wiki contains more extensive details on its use, experience will also help with this.

- All work, however small, is managed via Jira.
- Log all time against tickets - logging time ensures we are putting the effort into the right place
- Keep your ticket status up to date
- It's good etiquette to leave tickets unassigned, and trust it will be picked up by the appropriate person

## Doing Work

1. Start ticket and assign to self (in progress)
2. Finish work, place into review, add a link to the PR to be reviewed

## Reviewing Work

1. Set your name in the reviewer field - this stops anyone reviewing work at the same time as you
2. Perform review, see [Code Reviews](docs/code-reviews/) for more info.
3. Happy, transition to the next step as is appropriate for the work
3. Not happy? Fail the review, list reasons for failure in ticket comments
