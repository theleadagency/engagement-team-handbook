We're part of the wider development team here at The Lead Agency, with over ten people in a department of over twenty. We represent the development side of the Engagement Tribe of the business and work closely with our fellow tribe members in Marketing & Design. This cross slice allows us to work closer with our tribe mates, towards the same goals.

## What is the Engagement Tribe?

We're here to plan, work and maintain the systems and projects which engage directly with our wide customer base and convert them into delivering leads to our internal platform. These systems come in the form for PPC and organic traffic driven web sites, our ad delivery network and chat bots.

## Our Team

So what about us? The Lead Agency is all about cutting edge, lead generation. Like the rest of our colleagues, we live and breath this. We constantly challenge and strive to better our processes wherever possible; we research and adopt the latest technologies to solve our problems where appropriate. If something isn't working, we speak out and change that. It's not about criticism, it's about delivering solid solutions, to problems. We're programmers IRL.

## Our Work

We can split our work out into three parts; sites, ads & chatbots.

### Sites

We several main sites, and a lot of smaller partner projects we do for clients. Like business older than 15 years, we do have legacy, we aim to have all sites on Umbraco and there are active projects planned into to progress this.

- [Instant Compare](https://www.instantcompare.co.uk/) [Home] : Umbraco 7.7+
- [Car Keys](https://carkeys.co.uk) [Automotive]: Umbraco 7.7+
- [The Study Network](https://www.thestudynetwork.com/) [Education] : Orchard
- [Askaprice](https://www.askaprice.com/) [Automotive]: Legacy web forms framework

### Ads

We have built our own ad delivery network that allows us to partner up with clients and deliver more traffic to our main sites. The work we have done around this is entirely aimed at performance. We are scrape pages where ads are placed, calculate what products are being written about and precisely deliver a related ad. We use Microservices & CosmosDB to us to cache pages, and then deliver ads in under 100ms.

### Chat Bots

Our newest addition to the family is chat bots. This is our pioneering RnD project that we're prototyping across our sites (and soon partners sites) to deliver an authentic chat system which can be delivered through our own chat UI or via out systems like Facebook Messenger.
