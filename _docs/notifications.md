Notifications are great, but only when the are useful! To avoid spamming everyone, we try and adhere to the following rules.

## Source Control

Only send notifications for pull requests.

## Builds

Only send notifications for failed builds.

## Releases

Only send failure notifications - unless the release is to a live Environment.

It's good practice to email your release notes to key stakeholders and product owners.
