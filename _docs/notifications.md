Notifications are great, but only when the are useful! To avoid spamming everyone, we try and adhere to the following rules.

Send all notifications to Slack. This way people can opt in to channels, or adjust their preference to how they are alerted to them.

## Source Control

Only send notifications for pull requests.

## Builds

Only send notifications for failed builds.

## Releases

Only send failure notifications - unless the release is to a live Environment.

It's good practice to email your release notes to key stakeholders and product owners.
