## Branching

We use Git for all of our systems, and practice the two Git branching strategies. These strategies are dependent on the size and maturity of a system.

### Features

For basic projects, feature branches to master (via PR) are fine.

### Gitflow

See Atlassian guide on [Git Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
