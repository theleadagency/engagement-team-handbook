# Engagement Team Handbook

The handbook represents the defacto stop for The Lead Agency's Development, Engagement Team best practices and processes. It's the same guide you'll be given when you first join our team, and walks you through who we are and what we do.

Of course, if you're already working with us, it provides a great place to check some boxes to ensure your new project is consistent with the rest of systems.

## Making Suggestions

Suggestions or changes are super easy to make, they are exactly how we make changes at work. Simple create a new branch (or fork this repo), create a Pull Request and we'll review your changes as a team.
