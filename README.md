# TLA Development Team Handbook

This site is built with [hexo](http://hexo.io/), with a fork from our favorite front-end framework [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org)! Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`.

## Developing

``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm start # dev server at http://localhost:4000
```

## Deploying

The site is automatically deployed when commits land in `master`.

If you are the maintainer of a community translation fork and would like to deploy via Netlify instead of GitHub pages, please ping @yyx990803 in an issue to request a Netlify team membership and DNS update.
