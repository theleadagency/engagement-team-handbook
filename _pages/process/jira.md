# Jira

This will be a short run through of the Jira process we adopt. The Wiki contains more extensive details on its use, experience will also help with this.

- All work, however small, is managed via Jira.
- Log all work against tickets
- Keep your ticket status up to date
- It's good etiquette to leave tickets unassigned, and trust it will be picked up by the appropriate person

## Simple Personal Process

1. Start ticket and assign to self (in progress)
2. Finish work, place into review, add a link to the PR to be reviewed
