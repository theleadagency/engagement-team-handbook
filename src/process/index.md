## Process 

Defining and following process is an important thing at The Lead Agency (TLA). Consistency is always king, often a more valuable skill than any other. By documenting our processes here, we are able to maintain consistency and not only that, but, identify issues optimise them - collectively.

## How this handbook works

This handbook has been structured in a way that is representative of the classic Software Development Lifecyle. You don't have to read it front to back, you can jump in wherever you are within a current task.

We're also aiming to write this in such a way that it can be used as an easy reference. As the top of each section is a quick run through of steps to take to cover that particular process. We then get into the detail for times when you aren't familiar with that particular process. The aim of doing it in this way is to make it so this handbook can be open whenever you need it, so you can systematically run through quick checks to ensure your on the same lines as everyone else. If you get stuck, the details are there for when you need them.

## Keeping the handbook up to date

Technology and best practices are constantly evolving, so should this handbook. Updating is easy, the hard part is ensuring everyone agrees with your change! To update, clone the [handbook repo](https://github.com/theleadagency/engagement-team-handbook), make a branch for your change, implement then submit a PR for review from the team. If everyone is happy, we just approve the PR back into master.

Further details on how to make changes can be found in the project's README.
