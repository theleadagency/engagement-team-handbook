# Welcome

Welcome to the team, friend! This page is a handy run through all pages to visit and see, step-by-step, to get you up to speed with working with us. The aim of the handbook is to give you all the information you need to perform your tasks; it walks you through the team, through our processes and highlights our best practices. 

## Starting Out

So you've just joined The Lead Agency? Nice! We're sure someone has told you about The Lead Agency, but in case you were a little overwhelmed you can find out more about the business as a whole, right [here](https://www.theleadagency.com/about-us/). There should be plenty of other stuff from your induction to go through for help as well.

Next up, you've seen the view, you get the free beer on Fridays, and your relaxing at the thought of flexible working - what about this team you've joined? Everything in the about section here will help you out; to start [see what we do](/about/what-we-do).

## Starting to Walk

We're getting going now. We have a programme manager here, but that doesn't mean total dictatorship over your work, we like to think we're a little more autonomous that. We use [Jira](jira.theautonetwork.net) to manage our work, your level depends on how much you manage your own work, that will all become clear as time goes by. For now check out our [Jira process page]() page on how we work.
